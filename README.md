# MostOccurrencesOCR

This program reads a configurable path searching for image files (usually .jpg, .png or .pdf) and OCR's them using Tesseract engine counting the occurrences of each identified word in the document. After processing the documents, the Boxes API is called to transfer tagged data and file reference.
